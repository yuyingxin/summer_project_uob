This the code of my summer project.

Run Main.py to use the software.

Date period, number of article retrieved and keywords can be input to manipulate the visualization.

The offline version can only input keyword of 'china' and 'weather'
'downloads_china_offline' is the pre-download data for searching 'china'
'downloads_weather_offline' is the pre-download data for searching 'weather'

The online version take quite a lot of time. Be patient.

'pyprocessing' is a library from web.

pip install -r requirement
